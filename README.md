# Predict T cell dysfunction genes from TCGA Pancreatic Cancer Cohort

Author: Yufan Zhou

**Introduction**
  
Adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor expressing T (CAR T) cells has shown promising therapeutic efficacy against leukemia and lymphoma. However, CAR T cells in solid tumors fail to be as effective as in liquid tumors since they enter into a hyporesponsive (exhausted or dysfunctional) state that is induced by chronic antigen stimulation in cancer. To determine what kind of genes contribute to T cell exhaustion/ dysfunction from clinical patients sample would be meaningful to guide next-generation CAR T cell production. I identitified over two hundreds potential signatures of T cell dysfunction from pancreatic tumor cohort by testing how the expression of each gene in tumor interact with the classiscal T cell specific dysfunction biomarkers.
