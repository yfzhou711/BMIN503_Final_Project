# Signatures of T cell dysfunction and predict CAR-T immunotherapy response

Author: Yufan Zhou

**Introduction**
  
  Classical T cell specific dysfunction related genes were analyzed using the TCGA pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma cohorts. TCGA genomic data were downloaded from the UCSC cancer genome browser project. Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation test will be used to assess the strength of the relationship between each classical T cell specific dysfunction reference gene with rest of 50,000 genes. Different correlation data sets will be performed overlapping analysis. Two T cell dysfunction related datasets (2 RNA-Seq datasets) were downloaded frome the Gene Expression Ominiubus(GEO). Raw counts data will be generated by STAR-Featurecounts by HPC. Differential gene expression analysis will be implemented by Deseq2 and Limma. Overlapped genes from different gene datasets could be served as novel T cell dysfunction signatures.
